#### :thinking: What is Visual Reinforcement Learning?

**Visual Reinforcement Learning (Visual RL)** enables agents to learn decision-making policies directly from visual observations (e.g., images or videos), rather than structured state inputs.
It lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning and computer vision, with applications in robotics, embodied AI, games, and interactive environments.

#### ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Awesome-Visual-Reinforcement-Learning is a curated list of papers, libraries, and resources on learning control policies from visual input.
It aims to help researchers and practitioners navigate the fast-evolving Visual RL landscape â€” from perception and representation learning to policy learning and real-world applications.

### Benchmarks environments and datasets with Visual RL


### Visual Perception with RL
**Definition**: Focus on learning effective visual representationsâ€”including segmentation, depth estimation, and object recognitionâ€”from pixel inputs to guide RL agent decision-making.

### Visual World Models with RL
**Definition**: Learn predictive models of environment dynamics from visual inputs to enable planning and long-horizon reasoning in RL.
